# How to use Multiblocked2

Multiblocked2 is.. a pretty powerful mod. Hell, some would even call it a ***tool*** rather than a mod.

It allows players to make pretty complex machines, multiblocks and recipes, with built-in compatibility for other major mods like Create, Gregtech Modern, Mekanism, and even Pneumaticcraft: Repressurised.

That being said, it has a STEEP learning curve, even with KilaBash's tutorial videos.
