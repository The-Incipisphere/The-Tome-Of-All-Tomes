EVERYTHING HERE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE!</p> <p>Note</p> <p>This guide assumes the following constants:</p> <ol> <li>You have a working installation of Forge for Minecraft 1.20.1 (preferably Version 47.3.0 or above). If you don't, please download and install it from Forge's official site or through your launcher of choice.</li> <li>You know how to install mods. It can be either manually, or through your launcher of choice, but as long as you know how to properly install mods in the environment you're working with, that's all you need to be concerned with.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"guides/howToUseMultiblocked2Properly/#intro","title":"Intro","text":"<p>Multiblocked2 is.. a pretty powerful mod, to say the least.

Plus, it allows for dynamically defining new recipes for recipe types - a subject that I'll cover later.</p> <p>First, download and install the latest release of Multiblocked2 from https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/multiblocked2.</p> <p>Boot up your game, and make a new superflat world, with Creative mode &amp; Cheats enabled. This will allow you to keep the development of your custom machines &amp; multiblocks seperate from whatever main world you have.</p> <p>Once you've loaded in, run the command <code>/mbd2_editor</code>. It should bring up the following GUI:</p> <p></p>"}]}
